## Contributions
Members of this group were Andrew Crossman, Ben Flaggs (myself), Nik Korzoun, and Connor Mooney. Andrew Crossman made plot labels, checked the notebook for errors, reformmated code, then ensured that the code was PEP8 compliant. Ben Flaggs retrieved the data set from the SCEDC earthquake catalog, assisted with reading in, preparing, and selecting interested data, assisted in making the histograms in the data exploration section, and aided with understanding of the pseudocode. Nik Korzoun implemented the KS test, remade Fig. 1 and Table 1 from Corral 2018, and maintained code branches. Connor Mooney also assisted with reading in, preparing, and selecting valuable data, assisted in making histograms and aided with understanding of the pseudocode.

## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

*The overall objective of this homework was to reproduce the work in* [Corral 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.0055.pdf). *This included extracting a large set of data and running it through various analyses culminating in a KS Test of the appropriate extracted data.*
  
2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

*The hardest part of the homework was trying to figure out exactly how the KS Test works and implementing it into code*
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

*The easiest part of the assignment was interpreting the graphs and figures.*
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
  
*One new thing I have learned is how to use pandas to manipulate large data sets. I think this will be particlularly useful for my research in nanosctructures where I deal with very large quantities of data.*

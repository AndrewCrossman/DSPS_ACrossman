## Contributions
# Andrew Crossman:

*Derived the 'V^2 = 1/r' dependence on the velocity for a Newtonian framework of the galactic curve.*

*Developed the code to answer problem 1 in in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf) and ensured that it was PEP8 compliant.*

# Ben Flaggs:

*Read in and Cleaned up the galaxy data*

*Derived the angular and physical size of M31 through computational analysis*

*Drafted the `getradii` function*

# Nik Korzoun:

*Drafted the `vratios` function*

*Created the plots for the MW galaxy*

*Managed code branches*

# Connor Mooney:

*Assisted in developing the final draft of the `getradii` function*

*Developed the `plotGal` function*

## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

*This homework consisted of three main portions:*

*1 - Demonstrating the existance of dark matter by showing how galaxies' rotational curves do not follow the expected Newtonian behavior*

*2 - Applying error propogation to large sets of data and presenting the information with its respective error bars*

*3 - Using a simple MC sampling to show an application of the central limit theorem to distributions as the sampling size tends to infinity.*

  
2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

*The hardest part of this homework was getting the variance and kurtosis functions to run properly. Although very similar to the mean and skewness functions, the even powers that the varaicne and kurtosis were subjected to in their calulation were difficult to normailze.*
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

*The easiest part of this homework was writing the rest of the code for problem 1. I especially enjoying making good looking plots.*
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
  
*One new thing that I have learned is how to calculate the skewness and kurtosis of a discrete set of data points.*

## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Ensured PEP8 compliance. Assisted with debugging.

### Ben Flaggs:
Assisted in preprocessing data. Calculated intracluster variance. Applied k-means clustering and plotted variance over number of clusters. Plotted k-means clusters on 2d projection.

### Nik Korzoun:
Assisted with intracluster variance and plotting variance over number of clusters. Created distance matrix, histogram of pairwise distances, and applied DBSCAN clustering to 2d TSNE projection.

### Connor Mooney:
Preprocessed the data. Plotted the TSNE projection. Created agglomerative clustering dendrograms and 2D agglomerative clusters plot.

## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

*The goal of this homework was to apply various clustering methods to a multidimensional dataset. Most of the algorithms produced similar results.*

2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

*The hardest part of this homework was just trying to understand the high-dimensionality of the dataset, and consequently, visualizing how the distances between each point, the intracluster variances, and their projections into a two-dimensional space*
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

*The easiest part of this homework was ensuring PEP8 compliance. Most of the code was short and simple and did not even pass the 80 character limit per line.*
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
  
*I learned that the Minkowski metric can be used to extract the Manhattan distance.*

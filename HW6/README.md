## Improvements:

(1) Increase Font Size of All Labels and Tick Markers
      
      - before the text in the tick markers, titles, and legend were small and difficult to read 
      
(2) Changed the Data Colors
      
      - before the light blue and green could be hard to distinguish because they do not have significant contrast. This can be even more difficult for those with color blindness.
      - the new contrasting colors are much easier to distinguish even for those who are color blind

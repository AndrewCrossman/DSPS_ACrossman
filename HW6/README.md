## Improvements:

(1) Increase Font Size of All Labels
      - before the text was small and difficult to read
      
(2) Changed the Data Colors
      - before the light blue and green could be hard to distinguish because they do not have significant contrast. This can be even more difficult for those with color blindness.
      - the new contrasting colors are much easier to distinguish

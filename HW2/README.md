## Contributions
Andrew Crossman drafted BoltzmannDistribution.ipynb, found means of the histograms and compared to analytic values, then consulted formatting for PEP8. Ben Flaggs set the seeds for reproducability, and was responsible for verifying physics, writing Gaussian functions and fitting to distributions. Nik Korzoun tested and bugfixed CentralLimitTheorem.ipynb, captioned figures and maintained code branches. Connor Mooney plotted means as a function of sample sizes for varying distributions, and generated histograms of all distribution sample means.

## Summary
1. This homework was focused on exploring the properties of various distributions and how the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem affect the means of these distributions. These concepts were applied to the Maxwell Boltzman distribution and the Physics of gases.
2. The hardest part of this homework was determining the best way for our group to manage working on the same code through google collab and github.
3. The easiest part of this assignment was using the imported python libraries to generate distributions rather than having to paramaterize them ourselves.
4. The most interesting thing that I learned was that a Cauchy distribution has no well-defined mean.

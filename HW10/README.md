## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

*The goal of this homework was develop two different neural networks. One that can identify numbers and one that can increase the resolution of individuals faces. This relates to class because we solved these probelems using autoencoders.*

2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

*The hardest part of this homework was creating the layers and optimiazation of autoencoders such that they did exactly what we wanted instead returing poor results.  
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

*The easiest part of this homework was ensuring PEP8 compliance. Most of the code was short and simple and did not even pass the 80 character limit per line.*
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
  
*One thing I learned was that autoencoders can be very difficult to create such that they do exactly as you want.*

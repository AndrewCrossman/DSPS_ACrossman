# Offical Submission For Homework Nine by:

## Summary
1.**What was this homework about? Relate it to what we discussed in class.**

*This homework was about learning how Google's deepdream neural network operates and how we can use it with random photos. This is just an application of what we have been talking about in class about how neural netwrosk have different layers etc.*

2.**What was the hardest part of the homework for you?**

*The hardest part of this homework was trying to get a modified photo that looks 'good.' I ended up with one that looks like it may have some frogs or snakes.*
  
3.**What was the easiest part of the homework for you?**

*The easiest part of this homework was getting all of the code to funtion. I thought it was going to be much more difficult.*
  
4.**One new thing that you have learned**
 
*One thing I have learned is that neural networks are only good at what you tell them to look for (e.g., the network can find animals in photos even when there are no animals there.)*
